# AwesemoMinutes
SPA for modifying NBA minutes projections from awesemo.com

This is for Awesemo.com subscribers only, as you need the files that awesemo.com provides.

You can find sample files in the sample directory.

You can find the SPA here: https://metalburning.github.io/AwesemoMinutes/

Slight disclaimer: Awesemo's DK projection is slightly different, this is most likely due to how they project double doubles/triple doubles. This web-app just looks for if a player is projected for a double double or triple double and awards the points if theyre projected or not.

Tutorial:

1. Upload the "Projected Stats" file that awesemo provides.
2. Upload the Ownership file (DK or FD) that awesemo provides.
3. Modify minutes as you see fit.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the main page and download the modified "Projected Stats" file. Your changes will be reflected within this file. Or copy your changes in the table displayed at the bottom.
5. Save your changes to your browser via the save icon on the Database tab. (upper right corner)
6. Profit!
